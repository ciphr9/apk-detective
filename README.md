# apk-detective
This project's purpose is unpack an existing apk file to be able to make hard coded changes to its internal files (e.g. AndroidManifest.xml). Once all changes have been made as intended the script will pack the folder result to a fake-signed apk which can be tested by moving it to a real device or emulator.
