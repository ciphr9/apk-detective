# apk-detective
This project's purpose is unpack an existing apk file to be able to make hard coded changes to its internal files (e.g. AndroidManifest.xml). Once all changes have been made as intended the script will pack the folder result to a fake-signed apk which can be tested by moving it to a real device or emulator.

To be able to use this you will need to have setup Android SDK and Java JDK. For more information follow the instruction when executing the apkdetective.bat file.
